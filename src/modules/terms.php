            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    The materials on Meta Network’s website are provided on an “as-is” basis. Meta Network
                    makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other
                    warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of
                    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement of intellectual
                    property.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Further, Meta Network does not warrant or make any representations concerning the

            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>
                In no event shall Meta Network or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including,
                without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption)
                arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Meta Network’s website, even
                if Meta Network or an authorised representative has been notified orally or in writing of
                the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on
                implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages,
                these limitations may not apply to you.
